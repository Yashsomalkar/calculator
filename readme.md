# CSOC'22 Week1

  

This week, we'll jump with the basics of development with three tracks -

  

1. Android Development

  

2. Web Development

  

3. Cross Platform Development using Flutter

  

Having knowledge of the previous week is necessary since Git remains highly used in this week. If you think you're weak in any of the topics, then try to revise them.

  

There's a basic project in each track as well to finish by 7th june, so get your tools back in shape!

  

You may choose to compete in any number of tracks.

  

## Assignment

  

This week tasks will be on the basic of UI and UX development. It will comprise of making simple games like HANGMAN and CALCULATOR.

  

**Note** : You have to choose one of them.

  

### [HANGMAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))

  

The task that we'll be working over is to build a HANGMAN game, It is a simple word guessing game. The player tries to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

  

### Tasks

  

-  **Task 1**: Implement a hangman game. Create a word generator and generate random words in every game.

  

-  **Task 2**: Add a high score page to view the previous scores.

  

-  **Task 3**: Giving hints to users, by showing a few letters when the user needs them. Also, you could give signs when the entered letters are wrong.

  

-  **Task 4:** Make hard and easy mode with say, 5 lives in easy and 3 in hard mode. Also, word length and difficulty could be changed with respective levels. Easy words could have till 5 letters while difficult ones with longer words.

  

-  **Extras:** Adding a timer for making it more interactive and competitive.

  

### [CALCULATOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator)

  

The objective is that you need to build a Calculator which will perform at least our basic mathematical operations.

  

### Tasks

  

-  **Task 1**: Create a simple calculator with basic mathematical operations.

  

-  **Task 2**: Add complex operations including exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometry, etc.

  

-  **Task 3:** Add an option to change settings, say from radians to degrees and vice versa, and an option to change the theme of the app.

  

-  **Task 4:** Feature to show a history of previous calculations.

  

-  **Extras:** Add feature for matrix calculations and plotting of simple basic graphs using equations.

  

## Judging

  

The evaluation would be done mainly on the following basis:

  

1. User Interface and User Experience

  

2. Authenticity and readability of the code

  

3. Completion of mentioned tasks

  

4. Bonus Points for implementing extra features depending on your creativityðŸ˜‰

  

Remember, the deadline for this week's task is June 7th, 2022, at 23:59.
